Tic-Tac-Toe-Game--Assembly-Language-
====================================

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game with two symbols denoting the two players: X and O. The playing board is a 3x3 square. 

The rules are as follows:
•  Each player takes a turn placing his character (X or O) into one of the nine squares. 
•  A player cannot place his symbol in a square that is already occupied by a symbol.
•  The game ends when a player creates a winning combination of his symbols or when there are 
   no empty squares remaining.
•  Winning combination is defined as three horizontally adjacent, three vertically adjacent, or three
   diagonally adjacent symbols.
•  If neither player creates a winning combination when all nine squares are occupied, 
   the game is a draw, often referred to as a "cat game."
